jQuery-Mobile-Stepper-Widget
============================

Adds plus and minus buttons to a plain text-type input for use with jQuery Mobile.

There are improvements to be made I'm sure, but I've tested the horizontal version of this on
multiple devices and browsers. I haven't use a number-type input because many browsers add their
own tiny little increment/decrement buttons.

Check the demo html page for implemenation. Note: The vertical arrangement will expand to fill the width
of its container.
